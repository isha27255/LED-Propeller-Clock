# LED-Propeller-Clock

The propeller clock is a linear array of light emitting diodes, rotating at a high angular velocity to generate a circular screen. This project is based on a very simple principle which is “Persistence of vision”. Persistence of vision is “what we see is a blend of what we are viewing and what we viewed a fraction of a second before”.
